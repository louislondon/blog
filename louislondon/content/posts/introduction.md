Let me give a little introduction,

I'm Louis from Lewisham, London,

Where blue borough borders Southwark,

[Like Dave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkMQNRYlVAQ), I grew up near Peckham,

Teachers were giving man tests,

Smashed 4 A*s, so I entered,

[Comp Sci at Cambridge Uni](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/computer-science-ba-hons-meng),

And there I seemed so unique,

Head down, got my degree,

Then did research til two-three,

When my mental health got worse for me,

So I went straight back to [University](https://www.freeblackuni.com/),

I knew it was right, with certainty

But I'm not sure why to be honest,

This time, I studied [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumacher_College),

And learned more truths past logic,

[So this is where I blog it](https://www.louis.london/)
