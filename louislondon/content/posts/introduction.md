Let me give a little introduction,

I'm Louis from Lewisham, London,

Grew up where blue borough borders Southwark,

Like Dave, I grew up near Peckham,

Teachers were giving man tests,

I got 4 A*s, so I entered,

Comp Sci at Cambridge Uni,

And there I seemed so unique,

Head down, got my degree,

Did Cambridge research til two-three,

When my mental health got worse for me,

So I went straight back to University,

I'm not sure why to be honest,

This time, I studied economics,

And learned some truth past logic,

So this is where I blog it

I been learning all my life

And now it's sharing time
